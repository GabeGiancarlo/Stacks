   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Dependencies are managed via Swift Package Manager
   # Xcode will automatically resolve packages when you open the project
   ```

3. **Configure Firebase**
   - Firebase project: `intilted-v1` is already configured
   - **📋 Detailed Setup Guide**: See [docs/Firebase-Setup.md](docs/Firebase-Setup.md) for comprehensive configuration
   - Firebase Console: [https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/intilted-v1](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/intilted-v1/authentication/users)
   - Add iOS app with bundle identifier `com.intitled.intilted-v1`
   - Download `GoogleService-Info.plist` and add to project root

4. **Configure CloudKit**
   - CloudKit container: `iCloud.com.intitled.intilted-v1` (pre-configured)
   - Enable CloudKit in your Apple Developer account
   - CloudKit database setup matches Firebase project naming

5. **Assets Setup** (Required for UI completion)
   ```
   Create an Assets.xcassets folder with:
